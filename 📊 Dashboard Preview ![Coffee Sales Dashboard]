# Coffee-Sales-Analysis---Excel-Project
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of coffee sales performance, customer demographics, and product profitability. The primary objective was to transform over 1,000+ rows of raw transactional data into an interactive, user-friendly dashboard to drive smarter business decisions.
📊 Dashboard Visualizations & Analysis
This project translates raw coffee sales data into interactive visualizations, addressing key business questions through targeted dashboards.
1. Quantity Ordered Based on Orders
Objective: To understand overall demand volume and identify the most frequently purchased items by total units sold.
Analysis: This visualization highlights high-demand products, indicating which items require consistent inventory management. It differentiates volume leaders from revenue drivers.
2. Categories Distribution Based on Sales
Objective: To analyze how different product categories (e.g., Espresso, Latte, Brewed) contribute to total sales revenue.
Analysis: Reveals which categories are the financial powerhouses of the business. Insights here can guide marketing efforts and product development strategies.
3. Size Distribution Based on Sales
Objective: To determine customer preferences for product sizing (e.g., Small, Medium, Large) and its impact on revenue.
Analysis: Shows that while smaller sizes might have higher order counts, larger sizes often contribute disproportionately to the total sales value, guiding pricing and packaging strategies.
4. Footfall and Sales Over Various Timeframes
Objective: To map sales trends against customer traffic over daily, weekly, and monthly periods.
Analysis: Identifies peak operational hours and days (e.g., daily lunch rush, weekend spikes), allowing management to optimize staffing schedules and operational efficiency.
5. Top 5 Products Based on Sales
Objective: A focused look at the elite performers contributing the most to the bottom line.
Analysis: Pinpoints the "star" products that consistently generate top revenue, serving as key focus areas for promotion and quality control.
6. Orders on Weekdays vs. Weekends
Objective: To compare purchasing behavior patterns across the week.
Analysis: Provides a clear comparison between weekday regularity and potential weekend spikes, crucial for sales forecasting and inventory planning.
